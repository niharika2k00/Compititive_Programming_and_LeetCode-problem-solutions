  1) ARRAY MUST BE SORTED ALWAYSSSSSSS ........

  2) fIND MID = (START + END)/2
  
  3) use while loop / recurtion both same 

  4)  AT THE LAST ITERATION IN THE WHILE LOOP EVERYTIME THE END < START  BY 1 DIFFERENCE ,  So take that start and end at the end after the 
                    Loop iteration completes (this logic required in Minimum difference in Sorted Array).   

  5)  BITONIC ARRAY ---> array where we can apply binary search though it is not sorted 
                           Structure like a hill.
                           First the values increases then reaches a PEAK and after that it decreases.
