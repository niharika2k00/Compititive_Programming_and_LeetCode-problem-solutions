  1) fIND MID = (START + END)/2
  2) use while loop / recurtion both same 
  3)  AT THE LAST ITERATION IN THE WHILE LOOP EVERYTIME THE END < START  BY 1 DIFFERENCE ,  So take that start and end at the end after the 
                    Loop iteration completes (this logic required in Minimum difference in Sorted Array).
