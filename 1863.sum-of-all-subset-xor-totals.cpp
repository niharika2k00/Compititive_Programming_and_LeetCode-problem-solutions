    Explanation:
        The 8 subsets of[5, 1, 6] are : -The empty subset has an XOR total of 0. - [5] has an XOR total of 5. - [1] has an XOR total of 1. - [6] has an XOR total of 6. - [ 5, 1 ] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 = 4. - [ 5, 6 ] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 6 = 3. - [ 1, 6 ] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 6 = 7. - [ 5, 1, 6 ] has an XOR total of 5 XO
